## :glasses: C software Library for Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of C data structures and algorithms implemented from scratch. It is designed to provide efficient and reusable components for various programming tasks.

### Features
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of common data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary trees, and graphs.
- **Algorithms**: A variety of algorithms including sorting (quick sort, merge sort, etc.), searching (binary search, depth-first search, etc.), and graph algorithms (Dijkstra's, A* search, etc.).
- **Modular Design**: Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in a modular way, allowing for easy integration into other projects.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each component is well-documented with usage examples and explanations.
